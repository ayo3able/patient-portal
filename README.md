Hello
Introducing Patient Portal
I know the title seems like this should be for patients,
but it's actually for Physicians to keep track of their patients.

In this program a physician can add new appointments and patients
to keep track of both of those slippery little suckers.
And who can remember which patient has what appointment on any given
day.
When you first enter the Patient Portal you can sign up.
Then Patient Portal will take you to the sign up page where you can 
enter in your name and create your password. 
Patient Portal will take you to a page designed just for you(the physician)
to keep track of your patients with their appointments.
In the navigation bar, you have the options to see all of your patients, 
all of your appointments, make a new appointment for an existing patient, 
enter in a new patient and make an appointment for them, return back to your 
home page, and log out when your work is done.

Thank you for using Patient Portal have a nice day!!
